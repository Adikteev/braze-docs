## Requesting a review

Once you're ready for a member of the Braze Docs team to review your work, select **Ready for review**.

![]()

In the **Reviewers** section, select the **settings gear**, then add `@docs-team` as the reviewer.

![]()

If the docs team requests additional changes after their review, you'll be notified per your [GitHub notification settings](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications). If no changes are required, the Braze Docs team will approve and merge your changes.

Approved contributions will be deployed on the next Tuesday or Thursday. Be sure to check out [Braze Docs]() to see your hard work. Thanks for contributing!
