# B.Layer

> Welcome to the Braze partner template! Here, you'll find everything you need to create your partner page. In this first section, include a brief description of your company. Also, include a link to your main site.

[![B.Layer](https://braze-images.com/appboy/communication/assets/image_assets/images/6373679b954dfd049d24614d/original.png?1668507546)](https://blayer.phiture.com)

Using B.Layer together with braze will help you elevate your customer in-app experience. B.Layer is developed to help you build on-brand in-app messages that can be exported as a zip file or inline HTML to be uploaded to braze. We do not require any additional integration. This way you won't need developer resources which will save you time and budget.

In this second paragraph, explore the relationship between your company and Braze. This paragraph should explain how Braze and your company partner together to tighten the bond between the Braze user and their customer. Explain the "elevation" that occurs when a Braze user integrates with or leverages your partnership and the services you offer.

## Prerequisites

As B.Layer does not require a technical integration, all you need is a B.Layer account and HTML in-app messages enabled on braze.
To build an in-app message, you can create your message on B.Layer, download the HTML file onto your local drive and copy-paste or drag and drop it into your braze in-app message campaign.

{% alert important %}
The following requirements listed are typical requirements you might need from Braze. We recommend using the attributed titling and phrasing listed in the following chart. Be sure to adjust the descriptions and tailor them to your partnership integration.

## Use cases

Use cases can be a critical part of your documentation. Although optional, this is a good place to outline typical or even novel use cases for the integration. This can be used as a way to sell or upsell the relationship - it provides context, ideas, and most importantly, a way to visualize the capabilities of the integration.

With B.Layer there are endless opportunities to build and experiment with. Product recommendation sliders, Multi-screen onboarding or surveys, NPS, email capture, special offers, etc.
We are working with brands like Lifesum, Blinkist, OnX Hunt and many more to help improve their user experience without extra resources. We are also amongst the finalist of the APS Awards 2022 in the app innovation category.

Let's have a look at Lifesum, the world’s leading nutrition platform and by using B.Layer’s in-app messages the Lifesum team has recorded impressive wins. Lifesum measured a +12.48% increase in conversions to Premium among their segment of free users, while in their Premium segment itself, Lifesum measured a +22.88% increase in users who started a Meal Plan, a +58.82% increase in users who selected the "Runner's Diet" Meal Plan, and a +294.28% increase in users who selected the "Eat, Lift, Repeat" Meal Plan.

Another one is Blinkist. Keeping users consistently engaged with their content is a very particular challenge for Blinkist's book-summarizing subscription service. The team at Blinkist wanted to inspire their users without overwhelming them with too many books to read. B.Layer's in-app messages had an impressive 90% Click Through Rate while these messages also prompted users to consume more content in general. There was a 6.62% uplift in the overall book add rate and a 6.55% uplift in the overall start rate.

### Step 2: Short description of step two

Navigate to the hamburger menu on the top right > Click on brand assets > add your brand assets (colors and fonts)
You are all set. Now you can start designing your in-app message.



## Using this integration

B.Layer in-app messages come as zip file or inline HTML file. That way they can be dragged and dropped into your braze in-app message campaign.
You have the option in B.Layer to log button interactions or text input as a braze attribute. That can be done within the editor. A popular example is an NPS survey.
You can store the NPS score as an attribute to retarget your users afterwards. Additionally it is possible to store the feedback they give when using an open text field in the message.
Of course, there are many other options.

B.Layer uses braze button tracking added to the links you enter, e.g., ?button=0 - This way, you can see the button clicks in the analytics part of your campaign.

### Step 1: Short description of step one

The message output is an inline HTML file. Store it locally and go to your braze in-app campaign. Copy and paste the HTML into the HTML section.
If you decided to download a zip file, drag and drop the file into the little box above the code section.
That's it! Now you can go ahead and choose your segment and send details in braze.
