# Personalize.AI

Personalize.AI partners with Braze to unlock incremental value for Braze users by providing 1:1 personalization for messages and offers sent through Braze. P.AI has been used in conjunction with Braze with multiple clients during which we partnered to create impact from personalization and to drive double digit growth. With the value generated with the existing partnerships, there is significant value in partnering to go to new businesses with new capabilities and to provide additional value to existing clients. By making the existing integration deeper, Braze and P.AI can work in tandem to provide end to end marketing success. With P.AIâ€™s robust data science and AI capabilities, we see opportunity in working together to codevelop feature and leveling up the offerings for businesses.
