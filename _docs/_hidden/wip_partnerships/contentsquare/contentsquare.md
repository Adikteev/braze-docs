Leverage Contentsquare experience insights to multiply the bottom-line revenue driven by your investment in Braze. Improve relevance and conversion rates of your campaigns by targeting messages based on your customers’ digital experience and body language.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Contentsquare account | A Contentsquare account is required to take advantage of this partnership. |

## Use cases

Braze lets you create messaging campaigns that treat customers as the individuals that they are. But how can you enrich the targeting capabilities in Braze based on customers’ current intent and digital body language? And, how can you re-engage customers that suffered experience issues during their most recent website visits? Leverage Contentsquare experience insights to multiply the bottom-line revenue driven by your investment in Braze. Improve relevance and conversion rates of your campaigns by targeting messages based on your customers’ digital experience and body language.

**1) Deliver hyper-personalized retargeting campaigns**
Feature the products that your customer was most engaged with during their site visit, not just products that were glanced at.

**2) Humanize digital communications with empathy**
Send contextualized cart recovery emails, notifications, or messages that empathize with any digital experience issues or frustrations that customers experienced.

**3) Send more contextualized push notifications**
Increase open and conversion rates by sending push notifications with the right message at the right time based on your customer’s behavior.

**4) Build behavior-based audiences**
Go from a flat to a 3-dimensional understanding of customer intent vs actual experience. Create specific audiences in Braze based on key behavioral, frustration, and intent data. Then build automations and behavioral triggers in Brae.

With the Contentsquare x Braze integration, you can:

- Hyper-personalize messages based on customer intent, by surfacing CX data within Braze.
- Improve response and conversion rates by better targeting and personalizing messages.
- Retarget customers based on their digital behavior, hesitations, frustration, and intent.
- Achieve even higher digital sales and acquisition goals through contextualized campaigns.
- Identify poor experiences within Contentsquare and recover customers with targeted messages and retention offers.
- Recover at risk customers by sending more relevant and empathetic messages at the right time and the right place.
