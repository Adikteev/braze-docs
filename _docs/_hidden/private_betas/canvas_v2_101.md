# Canvas V2 101

## What is Canvas V2?

The Canvas V2 workflow is the new and improved editing experience that simplifies how marketers can build and manage their Canvas user journeys. With Canvas V2, you can expect to easily view and use [Canvas components]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components) in the Canvas builder. 

## What can I expect?

When using Canvas V2, you can expect the following:
* Full Steps will be replaced by lightweight Canvas components
* [Persistent entry properties]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_persistent_entry_properties/) will be available for message personalization throughout a user journey

Go to **Canvas** under the **Engagement** tab. Click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> **Create Canvas**. Next, you'll have the option of building with Canvas V2 or the original Canvas experience. Select **Canvas V2 Workflow** and begin building your Canvas as you normally would!

If you want to switch back to Canvas V1, click **Switch to Canvas V1 Workflow** at the bottom of the Canvas composer or at the top of the Canvas builder.

## What are the differences compared to Canvas V1?

Canvas V2 also has improvements in overall performance. Previously with the Canvas V1 workflow, a Full Step was added by default as the first step of your user journey. Now with Canvas V2, these Full Steps are removed to provide the benefit of more control of your editing experience. You can immediately select your Canvas step from the **Step** dropdown menu after clicking <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> **Add Step**. Then, proceed to building the remainder of your Canvas. 

## What will happen to my Canvases that I created using Canvas V1?

The current version of Canvas will continue to exist and be supported by Braze. Existing users will have the option of creating a Canvas using either the Canvas V1 or V2 workflow.

## I'm interested! How do I access Canvas V2?

Support for Canvas V2 is currently in early access. Please contact your Braze account manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
