# Canvas V2 101

## What is Canvas V2?

Canvas V2 is the new and improved editing experience that gives you the ability to use [Canvas components]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components) more efficiently. 

## What can I expect?

When using Canvas V2, you can expect the following:
* Removal of full steps
* Access to [persistent entry properties]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_persistent_entry_properties/)
* Improved dashboard experience

Go to **Canvas** under the **Engagement** tab. Click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> **Create Canvas**. Next, you'll have the option of building with Canvas V2 or the original Canvas experience. Select **Canvas V2 Workflow** and begin building your Canvas as you normally would!

If you want to revert back to the Canvas V1 workflow, click **Switch to Canvas V1 Workflow** at the bottom of the Canvas composer.

## What are the differences compared to Canvas V1?

Previously in Canvas V1, a default Full Step was added as the first step of your user experience. Now with Canvas V2, these full steps are removed to provide the benefit of more control of your editing experience. Compared to Canvas V1, the components displayed in Canvas V2 are more visible and usable. Canvas V2 also has improvements in overall performance.

## I'm interested! How do I access Canvas V2?

Support for Canvas V2 is currently in early access. Please contact your Braze account manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
