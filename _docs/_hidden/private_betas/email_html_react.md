# Updated HTML editor for email

> The updated HTML editor for email features a series of UI improvements, including a better code editing experience. 

With the updated HTML editor, you can seamlessly switch among editors (HTML, classic, plaintext, and AMP) with the top editor navigation. These options were previously hidden in a dropdown in the old HTML editor. This updated HTML editor also creates a consistent experience across our editors in other messaging channels, allowing Braze to more efficiently build universal improvements to these editors in the future.
