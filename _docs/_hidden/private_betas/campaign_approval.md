# Campaign Approval

This feature intends to add a review process prior to launching a campaign.  Available for Campaigns only, a new set of states will be available on the Campaign Confirmation workflow step  This ensures that each confirmation is 'approved' prior to launching the message.

## How it works

When launching a campaign, the confirmation page now offers a new state for each pill (Messages, Delivery, Target Population, and Conversion Events).  The default state is 'pending'.  Other states include 'Approved' or 'Deny'.
Once each pill has been approved, the launch button will now be enabled to launch the message.

In addition, an 'Approve All' is available by hovering over the 'Launch' button.
