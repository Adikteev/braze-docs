# Commenting in Canvas

Comments in Canvases can be a great collaborative space for your marketing team to identify, discuss, and review the finer details for your Canvases. As you build out a Canvas, you can make and manage comments to identify these areas that may require additional feedback from your colleagues.

## Benefits

Some benefits of commenting and including comment threads in your Canvas include:
- Keeping all details and discussions about a Canvas within a Canvas
- Reviewing edits to a Canvas and encouraging a sign-off process on these changes
- Identifying granular details of a Canvas, such as specific segmentation, including properties and attributes that are unique to a Canvas

## How to comment

In order to leave a comment in a Canvas, you must save a step first. So, when creating a new Canvas, you must first save the Canvas a draft. Or, as you're adding steps to an existing Canvas, you must save or update the Canvas.

To leave a comment, click the comment icon at the top of the Canvas. This will turn your cursor into a comment icon. Click the step you want to comment on. To revert your cursor, press the **Esc** key.

To view an existing comment, open the sidebar or click the comment icon on a step. You can also reply to existing comments in a thread.

## Managing comments

You can delete comments and threads you have created at the top right of a comment. You won't be able to delete another user's comments or threads. However, anyone can resolve a comment by selecting the resolve option.
