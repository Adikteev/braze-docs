# About campaign interaction data

> This article covers information about campaign interaction data and its availability.

Campaign interaction data refers to how a user interacts with a campaign they received (for example, when a user opens campaign A or a user receives variant A). This data can be accessed for retargeting the moment you need it.

{% alert important %}
Campaign interaction data is currently in early access. Contact your customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the early access. <br><br> Support for Canvas interaction data will be coming soon.
{% endalert %}

### When is campaign interaction data available?

For active campaigns, interaction data is always available in real-time. If a campaign is “stopped,” it will be marked as “expired” after three months, unless it's used in retargeting filters. When expired, the campaign data will be moved to long-term storage with limited availability. 

However, this is temporary because you can restore this data by using its interaction data for retargeting. To restore your campaign, follow these steps:

1. Go to the expired campaign.
2. At the top of this campaign's landing page, click **Restore interaction data** in the banner.
