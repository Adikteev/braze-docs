# Save as draft for Canvas

As you create and launch Canvases, you can also make edits to an active Canvas and save it as a draft, allowing you to pilot your changes prior to another launch. For example, if you're making large scale changes to an active Canvas, you can use this feature to create sections of these edits as drafts. By using these drafts, you can reference these edits in pieces to ensure that the appropriate changes are launched.

Saving drafts for Canvas Flow is currently in early access. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

You can create drafts within active Canvases to build, save, and quality-check prior to launching changes to active Canvases. 

While a draft exists, edits to the active Canvas cannot be made. However, you are able to view the active Canvas by clicking **View Active Canvas** in the Canvas footer from the analytics or the Canvas header from the draft. 

When in the analytics view or the active Canvas view, you can click **Edit Canvas** to return to the active Canvas.
