# Saving drafts for Canvas

As you create and launch Canvases, you can also make edits to an active Canvas and save it as a draft, allowing you to pilot your changes prior to another launch. For example, if you have an active Canvas that requires large scale changes, you can use this feature to create separate drafts for these edits. By creating these drafts, you can reference these edits in pieces to ensure that the appropriate changes are launched, giving you more control  .

{% alert important %}
Saving drafts for Canvas Flow is currently in early access. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

You can create drafts within an active Canvas to build, save, and quality-check **prior** to launching these changes in the active Canvas.

Note that edits to the active Canvas cannot be made while a draft of a Canvas exists. You can launch the draft to apply changes, or discard the draft.

To reference the active Canvas, click **View Active Canvas** in the footer from the analytics view or the Canvas header from the draft. When in the analytics view or the active Canvas view, you can click **Edit Canvas** to return to the active Canvas.
