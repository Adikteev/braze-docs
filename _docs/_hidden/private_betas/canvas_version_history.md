# Version history

Version history allows you to view and access Canvas analytics and the user journeys for any previous version of your Canvas. This can be especially helpful to maintain a record of the evolution of a Canvas. For example, if you make a largescale change, you can reference previous Canvas versions to better understand how your workflows have progressed.

{% alert important %}
Version history for Canvas Flow is currently in early access. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

As you edit and refine your Canvas, you can choose to overwrite the Canvas directly or to create a new version. When a new Canvas version is created, the users already in the Canvas will progress through the workflow of the new version. Users entering the Canvas will also enter the new version. Note that the Canvases listed under **Version history** are view-only. These previous versions can't be restored or deleted.

You can toggle between the Canvas analytics and the Canvas setup, including a detailed or simplified view and Canvas details. When you create a new version of a Canvas, you can still access past versions by clicking **# Versions** in the changelog.
