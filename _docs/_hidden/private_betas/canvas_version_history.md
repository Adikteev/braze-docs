# Version history

With version history, you can view and access analytics for any previous versions of your Canvas. As you edit and finetune your Canvas, you can choose to overwrite the Canvas directly or to create a new version. 

{% alert important %}
Version history for Canvas Flow is currently in early access. Contact your Braze customer success manager if you're interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

When you create a new version of a Canvas, you can still access past versions by clicking **# Versions** in the changelog modal. Note that the version history is view-only. Previous versions can't be restored or deleted.
