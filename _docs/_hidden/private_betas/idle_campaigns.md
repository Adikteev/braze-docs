# Idle status for campaigns

> This reference article explains the idle campaign status and provides answers to frequently asked questions.

## Frequently asked questions

#### What campaigns does this apply to?

This will apply to campaigns that already meet the above criteria, and campaigns that will meet the criteria moving forward.

#### How do I know if a campaign is idle?

Idle campaigns will be displayed in the Campaign digest under the "Idle" category pictured below. The date on which the campaign will be stopped will be listed below each campaign. Campaigns with end dates and one-time sends will be idle for 7 days prior to auto-stopping. Campaigns that have not sent a message in 11 months will be idle for 1 month prior to auto-stopping. 

#### What happens if an idle campaign is updated?

If a campaign that hasn't sent a message is updated, the 12-month countdown will reset. 

#### What happens if I want to continue running a campaign that hasn't sent a message or been edited in over 12 months?

Select the campaign's corresponding gear icon, and choose **Resume**. In this case, the 12-month countdown will reset. 

#### What happens if I want to continue running a campaign that's past its end date?

To resume a campaign that's past its end date, update the campaign's end date to the desired date. 

#### What happens to campaigns that haven't sent a message in 1 year, but have an end date in the future?

We will stop these campaign seven days after its end date.

#### How can I keep an idle campaign active?



#### Who will receive email notifications about stopped campaigns?

By default, all users with administrator permissions are opted into email notifications about auto-stopping campaigns. The creator of the campaign will always be notified when it is stopped. Users can manage email notification preferences by going to **Company Settings > Notification Preferences**, then adding or removing recipients from the notification **Campaign Automatically Stopped**.

#### Is there any action required?

No additional action is required. Please reach out to your Braze customer success manager if you have any questions.
