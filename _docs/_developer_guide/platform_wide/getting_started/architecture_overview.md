# Getting started: Architectural overview

At a high level, Braze is about data. The Braze platform, powered by the SDK, the REST API, and partner integrations, allows you to aggregate and act on your data. 
Braze pulls in data from a variety of sources. 

* You get insights into this data through real-time reports and analytics.
* Your marketing team dynamically segments your user base using these metrics. 
* Your marketing team acts on the data, creating content through a variety of messaging channels such as SMS and email. 
* Then, Braze tracks your users' engagement with this messaging and feeds it back into the platform, creating a loop.
