# Getting started: Platform overview

> Braze is a customer engagement platform. This simply means that Braze helps you listen to your users, understand your usersâ€™ actions and behaviors, and then act on them. The Braze platform has three primary components: the SDK, the dashboard, and the REST API.

## SDK

The Braze SDKs can be integrated into your mobile and web applications to provide powerful marketing, customer support, and analytics tools. 

## Dashboard user interface

The dashboard is the UI that controls all of the data and interactions at the heart of the Braze platform. The dashboard is how most marketers interact with Braze. Marketers use the site to manage notifications, setup targeted messaging campaigns, and view analytics. Developers use the dashboard to manage settings for integrating apps, such as API keys and push notification credentials. If you're just getting started, learn how to [access the dashboard][1].

## REST API

The Braze API provides a web service where you can record actions taken by your users directly via HTTP, rather than through the mobile and web SDKs. This allows you to add custom events for segmentation purposes directly from a web-based application. The [API guide][2] lists available Braze API endpoints and their uses.

## Granular targeting and analysis

### App analytics
The Braze dashboard displays graphs that are updated in real-time based upon a number of analytics metrics as well as custom events that you instrument in your application.

### User segmentation

Segmentation allows you to create groups of users based on powerful filters of their in-app behavior, demographic data, etc. Braze also allows you to define any in-app user action as a "custom event" if the desired action is not captured by default. The same is true of user characteristics via "custom attributes". After a user segment is created on the dashboard, your users will move in and out of the segment as they meet (or fail to meet) the defined criteria. For example, you can create segment that includes all users who have spent money in-app and last used the app more than two weeks ago.

![An example segment where the filters "Last made purchase more than 7 days ago" and "Last used these apps more than 4 weeks ago" are set.][3]

## Multichannel messaging

Once you have defined a segment, Braze's messaging tools allow for multichannel communication with your users. For example, send a push notification and email to the example segment defined in the previous section. Messaging channels are best used in concert and with regularity to re-engage lost users, retain active users, and energize your brand ambassadors. Moreover, you can use our advanced scheduling options to automate campaigns to specific groups of those users going forward.
