guide_top_text: "Feature flags allow a developer to remotely enable or disable functionality for a specific or random selection of users. Importantly, they let you turn a feature on and off in production without additional code deployment or app store updates. This allows you to safely roll out new features with confidence. <br><br>
For example, if your team has built a new profile page for your ride-sharing app, instead of releasing it (and potential bugs) to your entire user base, you can roll out the new profile page to just 5% of all users as a way to mitigate risk. "
