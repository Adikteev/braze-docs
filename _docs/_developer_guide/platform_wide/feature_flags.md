# Feature flags

Feature flags allow you to remotely enable or disable functionality for a specific section of your user base. Importantly, they let you turn a feature on and off in production without additional code deployment or app store updates. This allows you to safely roll out new features with confidence. 

Create a new feature flag within the Braze dashboard by providing a name and an `ID`, a target audience, and a percentage of users for whom to enable to this feature. Then, using that same `ID` in your app or website's code, you can run certain parts of your business logic.

For example, if you've built a new profile page for your ride-sharing app, instead of releasing it (and potential bugs) directly to your entire user base, you can roll out the new profile page to only a single segment. 

## Prerequisites

To use feature flags, ensure your SDKs are up to date with at least these minimum versions:
<!-- TODO -->
{% sdk_min_versions android:9999 web:4.4.0 swift:9999 %}

## Implementation
Manage, create, and delete feature flags by navigating to **Feature Flags** in the left sidebar of the Braze dashboard. This page displays a list of existing feature flags for this app group.

### Create a new feature flag
To create a new feature flag, click the **Create Feature Flag** button. Then, define your feature flag's [details](#details), [properties](#properties), user [targeting](#targeting), and [rollout traffic](#rollout-traffic).

<!-- TODO -->
[Josh: ADD SCREENSHOT]

#### Details
Give your new feature flag a **Name** and **ID**. 
* The **Name** field allows you to provide a human-readable title for this feature flag that will be used by marketers and administrators. 
* The **ID** field will be called in your code to determine whether the feature is enabled for a particular user. 
* The **Description** field is an optional field that allows you to provide additional context around this feature flag.


{% alert important %} 
To prevent breaking production app behavior, feature flag `ID`s should be both unique and immutable. 

A feature flag `ID` is unique. The same `ID` is used across app groups so that different platforms (i.e., iOS/Android/Web) can share references to the same feature. Once set, the feature flag `ID` should not be changed.
{% endalert %}

Choose an `ID` thoughtfully as it will be used as you develop your feature. Practice good naming conventions to ensure that your code is readable by your colleagues (and your future self).

#### Properties
To update your app remotely, define variables as key/value pairs for your feature flag. These properties will be passed to your app through the Braze SDK. Defining properties is an optional step.

Variables can be **strings**, **boolean** values, or **numbers**. Define both the variable key and default value for each property.

For example:

<!-- TODO -->
[David: Add example]

[Question: Is there any limit to the number of properties that can be added to a feature flag?]

#### Targeting
To target a particular [segment]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/) of users for your feature rollout, use the **Add Segment** dropdown menu.

If no segment is selected, the percentage of targeted users (see [Rollout Traffic](#rollout-traffic), below) will come from your entire user base. You can add multiple segments to target.

To filter users out of your target audience, use the **Add Filter** dropdown menu. You can add multiple filters to narrow your audience.

<!-- TODO -->
[David: Is there any limit to the number of segments or filters that can be added to a feature flag?]

#### Rollout Traffic
Feature flags always start as disabled to allow you to separate the timing of the feature's release and activation in your users' experience. When you are ready to rollout your new feature, use the **Rollout Traffic** slider to randomly define a portion of your targeted user base to receive the new feature. Set the **Rollout Traffic** slider to set a percentage between 0% (no users) and 100% (the entire target audience). 

{% alert warning %} 
Do not set your rollout traffic above 0% until you are ready for your new feature to go live. When you initially define your feature flag in the dashboard, leave this setting at 0%.
{% endalert %}

### Check for the feature flag in your application
Once you have defined your feature flag, configure your app to check whether or not it is enabled for a particular user. When it is enabled, you'll set some action or reference the feature flag's variable properties based on your use case. 

Let's say you were to rolling out a new type of user profile for your app. You might set the `ID` as `expanded_user_profile`. Then, you would have your app check to see if it should display this new user profile to a particular user. For example:

{% tabs %}
{% tab Javascript %}
```javascript

const {enabled, properties} = braze.getFeatureFlag("expanded_user_profile");
if (enabled) {
  console.log(`expanded_user_profile is enabled`, properties);
} else {
  console.log(`expanded_user_profile is not enabled`);
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Swift %}
```swift
todo copy example from web
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Java %}
```java
todo copy example from web
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Kotlin %}
```kotlin
todo
braze.getFeatureFlag("expanded_user_profile")

copy example from web


```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The Braze SDK uses getter methods to pull your feature flag's properties into your app. It refreshes these properties during app start so that it displays the most up-to-date version of your feature upon launch. The SDK caches these values so your app can be used while offline. 

You can also get a list of all enabled feature flags:

{% tabs %}
{% tab Javascript %}
```javascript
const features = getAllFeatureFlags();
for(const feature of features) {
  console.log(`Feature: ${feature.id}`, feature.enabled, feature.properties);
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Swift %}
```swift
todo copy example from web
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Java %}
todo copy example from web

{% endtab %}
{% tab Kotlin %}
todo copy example from web
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Refresh flags
You can set a flag to request a refresh if your rate limit/throttling allows.

<!-- TODO -->
[David: Some additional context would be worthwhile here.]

{% tabs %}
{% tab Javascript %}
```javascript
braze.refreshFeatureFlags(() => {
  console.log(`Feature flags have been refreshed`);
}, () => {
  console.log(`Failed to refresh feature flags.);
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Swift %}
```swift
todo copy example from web
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Java %}
```java
todo copy example from web
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Kotlin %}
```kotlin
todo copy example from web

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}


#### Listen for changes
You can configure the SDK to listen and update your app if a refresh changes a flag's value.

[David: Some additional context would be worthwhile here.]

{% tabs %}
{% tab Javascript %}
```javascript
// register an event listener
const subscriptionId = braze.subscribeToFeatureFlagsUpdates((features) => {
  console.log(`Features were updated`, features);
});
// unregister this event listener
braze.removeSubscription(subscriptionId);
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Swift %}
```swift
todo copy example from web
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Java %}
```java
todo copy example from web
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Kotlin %}
```kotlin
todo copy example from web
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Use cases
Feature flags have a few different strategic uses, outlined below.

### Gradual rollouts
Use feature flags to gradually enable features to a sample population. For example, you can soft launch a new feature to your VIP users first. This strategy helps mitigate risks associated with shipping new features to everyone at once and helps catch bugs early. 

For example, imagine that you have an ecommerce product that now comes in multiple colors and you want to implement a new color selector so users can specify which color to purchase. You can release this new feature but only enable it for 5% of your users in Braze. If all goes well, you can gradually increase to 20%, 50%, and eventually 100%. If a critical bug is discovered, you can roll back feature enablement to 0% without requiring an additional code release. 

### Remotely control app variables 
Use feature flags to modify your app's functionality on-the-fly. This can be particularly important for mobile apps, where updates canâ€™t be rolled out as quickly to all users.

For example, you can change homepage links or banners on the fly using a feature flag's property values. You can even dynamically personalize this content using Braze profile attributes.

<!-- TODO -->
[David: Can you provide some examples of how they would do this?]

### Message coordination
Use feature flags to coordinate feature rollout and messaging simultaneously. This will allow you to use Braze as the source of truth for both your user experience and its relevant messaging. To achieve this, target the new feature to a particular segment or filtered portion of your audience. Then, create a Campaign or Canvas that only targets that segment. 

### Feature experimentation
Use feature flags to experiment and confirm your hypotheses around your new feature. By splitting traffic into two or more groups, you can compare the impact of a feature flag across groups, and determine the best course of action based on the results.

With Canvas, you can track the impact of feature rollout on conversations. And, using [Experiment Paths]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/experiment_step#experiment-paths), you can optimize these conversions by testing different messages or paths against each other and determining which is most effective. Use the Winning Path as you progressively rollout your feature to a wider audience.

For example, imagine that your ecommerce team has a new checkout page design that they believe will improve purchase conversion rates. When you release this feature, you can display the new page to 50% of your users for one month. If it performs better than the old design, you can increase the rollout traffic to 100%. If it performs poorly, you can turn it off completely and revisit the designs. In either case, you have avoided a poor experience for 50% of your users.
