# Key-value pairs

`ab.Card` objects may optionally carry key-value pairs as `extras`. These can be used to send data down along with a card for further handling by the application. Simply call `card.extras` to access these values.

See the JSDocs for more information on [ab.ClassicCard][3], [ab.Banner][4], and [ab.CaptionedImage][5].
