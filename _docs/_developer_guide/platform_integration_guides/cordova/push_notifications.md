# Push notification integration

If you use the Cordova SDK default setup, you won't have to make any new changes client-side to implement basic push functionality. For modified integrations, see the native [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/push_notifications/integration/standard_integration/) or [iOS]({{ site.baseurl }}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/push_notifications/integration/) integration instructions.

## Additional Customizations

### Rich push notifications

#### Step 1: Follow the native integration steps

First, follow the native [iOS rich push integration tutorial](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/b2-rich-push-notifications) to create a notification service extension in Xcode.

#### Step 2: Modify your Podfile

Next, open your Podfile. If `BrazeNotificationService` is already declared in your main application's target from a previous install, be sure to remove it.

{% alert warning %}
The iOS Podfile is automatically generated by Cordova and will be overridden every time you re-sync your plugins. Due to limitations in the Cordova tooling, the process of generating an Xcode app extension cannot be automated, so you will need to manually repeat this step anytime your project dependencies are updated.
{% endalert %}

Append the following target to your Podfile, where `{your-notification-service-extension-target}` is the name of the notification service extension target you created. Ensure that you use static linking to avoid any duplicate symbol errors.

```ruby
target '{your-notification-service-extension-target}' do
  use_frameworks! :linkage => :static
  pod 'BrazeNotificationService'
end
```

#### Step 3: Re-install your dependencies

Navigate to your `/platform/ios` directory and run `pod install`.

### Push stories

#### Step 1: Follow the native integration steps

Similarly, follow the native [iOS push stories integration tutorial](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/b3-push-stories) to create a notification content extension in Xcode.

#### Step 2: Modify your Podfile

Next, open your Podfile. If `BrazePushStory` is already declared in your main application's target from a previous install, be sure to remove it.

{% alert warning %}
The iOS Podfile is automatically generated by Cordova and will be overridden every time you re-sync your plugins. Due to limitations in the Cordova tooling, the process of generating an Xcode app extension cannot be automated, so you will need to manually repeat this step anytime your project dependencies are updated.

Append the following target to your Podfile, where `{your-notification-extension-target}` is the name of the notification content extension target you created. Ensure that you use static linking to avoid any duplicate symbol errors.

```ruby
target '{your-notification-extension-target}' do
  use_frameworks! :linkage => :static
  pod 'BrazePushStory'
end
```

#### Step 3: Re-install your dependencies

Navigate to your `/platform/ios` directory and run `pod install`.
