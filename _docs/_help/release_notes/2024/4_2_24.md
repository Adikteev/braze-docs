# April 2, 2024 release

## Shopify OAuth

You can now [enable OAuth for Braze]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/ecommerce/shopify/setting_up_shopify/) in your Shopify workspace.

## WhatsApp

### Multiple business accounts

Now you can add multiple WhatsApp Business accounts and subscription groups to each workspace. For a full walkthrough, see [Multiple WhatsApp Business accounts and phone numbers]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/overview/multiple_subscription_groups/).

### Read rates

WhatsApp is testing new approaches, starting with consumers in India, to create more valuable experiences and maximize engagement with businessesâ€™ marketing conversations. This may include limiting the number of marketing conversations a person receives from any business in a given period, starting with a small number of conversations that are less likely to be read. Braze will get an error code if a message is not delivered.

WhatsApp will start considering read rates as part of our quality rating for marketing templates, alongside traditional metrics like blocks and reports. WhatsApp may temporarily pause marketing message campaigns with low read rates, giving businesses time to iterate on the templates with the lowest engagement before scaling volume beginning on April 1, 2024.

For more information, see [Meta resources]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/meta_resources/).

## Data flexibility

### Sync your Amazon S3 bucket to Braze

You can now use Cloud Data Ingestion for S3 to directly integrate one or more S3 buckets in your AWS account with Braze. When new files are published to S3, a message is posted to SQS, and Braze Cloud Data Ingestion takes in those new files. For more information, see [File storage integrations
]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/cloud_ingestion/file_integrations/).

### iOS push notifications using Expo

We added instructions for integrating rich push notifications and push stories into your iOS app [using Expo with React Native]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/react_native/push_notifications/?tab=expo).

## Remote start live activities on iOS
