# March 5, 2024 release

## Google EU User Consent Policy

Google is updating their [EU User Consent Policy](https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy/) in response to changes to the [Digital Markets Act (DMA)](https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2023/10/updates-to-customer-match-conversion.html), which goes into effect March 6, 2024. This new change requires advertisers to disclose certain information to their EEA and UK end users, as well as obtain necessary consents from them. As part of this upcoming change, you can [collect both consent signals in Braze as custom attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/canvas_steps/google_audience_sync/#collecting-consent-for-eea-and-uk-end-users). Braze will sync the data from these custom attributes to the appropriate consent fields in Google.

## Data flexibility

### Message archiving support for AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage

You can use [message archiving]({{site.baseurl}}/) to save a copy of your messages sent to users for archival or compliance purposes to your AWS S3 bucket, Azure Blob Storage container or Google Cloud Storage bucket.

### SQL table reference

Visit the [SQL table reference]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/sql_segments/sql_segments_tables/) to see the tables and columns available to be queried in the Query Builder or when generating SQL Segment Extensions.

## Unlocking creativity

### A/B test projection

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

[A/B test projection]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/multivariant_testing/ab_test_projection/) uses neural networks to predict which subject lines perform best. Our model extracts linguistic features from winning A/B tests performed on Braze and uses those statistical language patterns to teach our AI what makes better subject lines.

## Robust channels

### Quick push campaigns

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

When creating a push campaign in Braze, you can select multiple platforms and devices to craft one message for all platforms in a single editing experience called [quick push]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/creating_a_push_message/quick_push/). This feature is only available for campaigns.

### Multiple pages for in-app messages

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

[Adding pages to your in-app message]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/drag_and_drop/create/#multi-page) lets you guide users through a sequential flow, like an onboarding flow or welcome journey. You can manage pages from the **Pages** section of the **Build** tab.

### Email capture form

[Email capture messages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/traditional/customize/email_capture_form/) allow you to easily prompt users of your site to submit their email address, after which it will be available in their user profile for use in all your messaging campaigns.

### Custom list-unsubscribe header

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Adding a [custom list-unsubscribe header]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings/#custom-list-unsubscribe-header) to your email messaging allows your recipients to opt-out. This way, you can add your own configured one-click unsubscribe endpoint and an optional “mailto:”. Braze requires an input for URL to support a custom list-unsubscribe header because the one-click unsubscribe HTTP is a requirement from Yahoo and Gmail for bulk senders.

    - `BrazePlugin.getFeatureFlag(id)` will now return `null` if the feature flag does not exist.
    - `BrazePlugin.subscribeToFeatureFlagsUpdates(function)` will only trigger when a refresh request completes with success or failure, and upon initial subscription if there was previously cached data from the current session.
