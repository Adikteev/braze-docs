# February 2022

## Invalid phone numbers endpoints
You can now manage invalid phone numbers using the new [Braze SMS Endpoints]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/sms/)! The two new additions are:
- [GET: Query or list invalid phone numbers endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/sms/get_query_invalid_numbers/) returns a list of phone numbers that are considered "invalid" by Braze.
- [POST: Remove invalid phone numbers endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/sms/post_remove_invalid_numbers/) allows you to remove the "invalid" phone numbers from Braze's invalid list.

## Rate limits
API rate limits have been included for all [Braze Endpoint articles]({{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#nav_top_endpoints). You can now easily view the rate limits by request type. For more information on rate limits, check out our article on [API rate limits]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_limits/).

## New REST endpoint
Braze has added a [new EU-02 REST Endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/basics/#api-definitions).
