# May 2, 2023 release

## Query builder

With the [query builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder), you can generate reports using Braze data in Snowflake. The query builder comes with pre-built SQL query templates to get you started, or you can write your own custom SQL queries to unlock even more insights.

## Canvas version history

[Version history]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/managing_canvases/canvas_version_history/) allows you to view and access Canvas analytics and the user journeys for any previous version of your Canvas. Referencing your Canvas version history can be especially helpful to maintain a record of the evolution of a Canvas.

## New API and SDK endpoints article

Braze manages a number of different instances for our dashboard, SDK, and REST endpoints, which we call "clusters." Check out [API and SDK endpoints]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/sdk_endpoints) for a list of dashboard URLs, API endpoints, and SDK endpoints for available Braze instances.

## Incremental refresh for SQL Segments

You can now create [SQL Segment Extensions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/sql_segments/) that use incremental refresh, which only refreshes the last 2 days worth of data. This is more cost-efficient and uses up fewer SQL Segment credits each time the segment membership refreshes. Unlike full refresh extensions, you can set incremental refresh extensions to automatically regenerate membership daily.
