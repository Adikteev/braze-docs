# January 10, 2023 release

## User Update 

The User Update component allows you to update a user’s attributes, events, and purchases in a JSON composer, so there’s no need to include sensitive information like API keys. To learn more, check out [User Update]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/user_update/).

## Setting subscription groups via API

When creating new users via the [/users/track]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/) endpoint, you can set subscription groups within the user attributes object, which allows you to create a user and set the subscription group state in one API call.
