## Shopify catalogs

You can enrich your abandoned cart, order confirmation, and more with the most up-to-date product details and information.

## Merging users by email

You can now [merge users by email]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_users_merge/#merging-users-by-email) using the `/users/merge` endpoint. 

{% alert important %}
Merging users by email and using `/users/merge` with mismatched identifiers are currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if you’re interested in participating in the early access.

## Best practices for WhatsApp

Before sending your WhatsApp messages, you can reference suggested [best practices]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/whatsapp/whatsapp_best_practices/) to maintain a high phone quality rating, avoid blocks and reports, and opt-in and out-out users.

## Domain reputation

In the Deliverability Center, you can view and monitor your [domain reputation]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/deliverability_center#domain-reputation).

## Card creation in Canvas

## Copying to workspaces

[Copying campaigns across a workspace]({{site.baseurl}}/copying_to_workspaces/) allows you to get a jumpstart on your message composition by starting with a copy of a campaign in a different workspace. This copy will remain as a draft until you edit and launch, helping you keep and build off your successful messaging strategies.

{% alert important %}
Copying campaigns across workspaces is currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if you’re interested in participating in this early access.
