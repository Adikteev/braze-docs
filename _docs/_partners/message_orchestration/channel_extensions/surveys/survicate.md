# Survicate

> [Survicate][1] is an NPS and customer feedback survey software that helps you get a constant stream of user insights at all stages of the funnel.

The Braze and Survicate integration allows you to include Survicate survey links or survey snippets in your Braze campaigns and Canvases. Being able to embed the first survey questions into your email's body has shown to increase the response rate. After running your surveys, return to Survicate to identify and analyze the attributes of your survey responders.

### Step 1: Create your survey in Survicate

Log in to your Survicate account and click the **Create new survey** button. Select **email or shareable link survey** type, and start designing your survey from scratch or choose from over 100 ready-to-use survey templates.

### Step 2: Connect your survey to Braze

Once the survey is ready, move to the **Configure** tab in Survicate and select **Braze** from the dropdown list of tools you can use to identify your respondents. Now, you don’t need to ask respondents for their contact details.

Go to the **Share** tab in Survicate, and choose a preferred option of a survey placement. You can either get a direct link (which you can later hide under a button or hyperlink in Braze) or embed the first question into the email’s body using the HTML code.
