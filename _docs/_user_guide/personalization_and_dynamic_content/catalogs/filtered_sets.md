# Filtered sets

After creating a [catalog]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/catalog/), you can further reference this data by incorporating filtered sets in your Braze campaigns. Filtered sets are groups of data that can be used to personalize a message for each user in your campaign.

{% alert important %}
Filtered sets are currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if you are interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

To create a filtered set, select your catalog and click **Create Filtered Set**. Select the catalog column from the **Filter Field** dropdown. Next, select the operator, and enter the attribute. This filtered set will determine the information set up for each user.
