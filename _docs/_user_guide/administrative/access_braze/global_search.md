# Global search

Global search is a powerful feature that helps you locate campaigns, Canvases, segments, and email templates within Braze with greater ease. You can use the global search to find what you're looking for from anywhere in the Braze platform.

{% alert important %}
Global search is currently in early access and is under active development. Please share your thoughts, suggestions, and any issues you encounter using the feedback option at the bottom-right of the search dropdown. If you are interested in participating in the early access, contact your Braze customer success manager.
{% endalert %}

## What can you search for?

During the early access, you can search for campaigns, Canvases, segments, and email templates. In the global header of Braze, select <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> **Search** (or use the [keyboard shortcut](#keyboard-shortcuts)), and a dropdown search menu will open.

## Key features

### Keyboard shortcuts

Navigate through search results effortlessly with keyboard shortcuts:

<style>
  div.small_table + table {
    max-width: 60%;
  }
table th:nth-child(1),
table th:nth-child(2),
table td:nth-child(1),
table td:nth-child(2), {
    width:20%;
}
table td {
    word-break: break-word;
}
</style>

<div class="small_table"></div>

| Action                      | Keyboard shortcut                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open the search menu        | {::nomarkdown} <ul> <li> Mac: <kbd>⌘</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>K</kbd> </li> <li>Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>K</kbd> </li> </ul> {:/}  |
| Move between search results | <kbd>⬆</kbd> / <kbd>⬇</kbd>  |
| Select a search result      | <kbd>Enter</kbd>    |
| Close the search menu       | <kbd>Esc</kbd>  |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

### Content type and status tags

Each search result is paired with tags that indicate the result's content type (campaign, Canvas, segment, or email template) and status (active, archived, stopped, etc.).

### Access recently opened content

You can revisit recently accessed content from the search menu. The search interface displays your recently opened results below the search bar, including items interacted with throughout the entire Braze platform. This lets you return to previously viewed campaigns, Canvases, segments, or email templates so you can pick up right where you left off with fewer clicks.
