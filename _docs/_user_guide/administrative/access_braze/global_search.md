## What can you search for?

Anything! Not only can you swiftly find campaigns, Canvases, segments, and templates, but you can also navigate to specific pages and even execute quick actions like creating a campaignâ€”all from the search bar.

## Key features

### Keyboard shortcuts

Navigate through search results effortlessly with keyboard shortcuts:

<style>
  div.small_table + table {
    max-width: 60%;
  }
table th:nth-child(1),
table th:nth-child(2),
table td:nth-child(1),
table td:nth-child(2), {
    width:20%;
}
table td {
    word-break: break-word;
}
</style>

<div class="small_table"></div>

| Action                      | Keyboard shortcut                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open the search menu        | {::nomarkdown} <ul> <li> Mac: <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>K</kbd> </li> <li>Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>K</kbd> </li> </ul> {:/}  |
| Move between search results | <kbd>â¬†</kbd> / <kbd>â¬‡</kbd>  |
| Select a search result      | <kbd>Enter</kbd>    |
| Close the search menu       | <kbd>Esc</kbd>  |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2}

### Content type and status tags

Each search result is paired with tags that indicate the result's content type (page, campaign, Canvas, segment, email template) and status (active, archived, stopped, etc.).

### Access recently opened content

You can revisit recently accessed content from the search menu. The search interface displays your recently opened results below the search bar, including items interacted with throughout the entire Braze platform. This lets you return to previously viewed campaigns, Canvases, segments, or email templates so you can pick up right where you left off with fewer clicks.

### Find pages that have been renamed

The search understands synonyms for pages that have been renamed in our [updated navigation]({{site.baseurl}}/navigation). For example, it will find "Data Export" when you search for "Currents", as that page has been renamed.

### Quick create campaigns

Search for channels to see quick create options among your top 10 results. For example, searching for "email" shows "Create Email Campaign" or "Create Transactional Email Campaign".

### Search for emojis

Do you use emojis when naming your work in Braze? Search for them! You can use emojis as search queries. ðŸ˜Ž
