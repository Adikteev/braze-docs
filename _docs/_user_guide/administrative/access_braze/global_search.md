# Global search

Global search is a powerful feature that helps you locate campaigns, Canvases, segments, and email templates within Braze with greater ease. Use the global search to find what you're looking for without the hassle of scrolling and navigating through menus.

{% alert important %}
Global search is currently in early access and is under active development. Please share your thoughts, suggestions, and any issues you encounter using the feedback option at the bottom-right of the search dropdown. If you are interested in participating in the early access, please get in touch with your customer success manager.
{% endalert %}

## What can you search for?

During the early access, you can search for campaigns, Canvases, segments, and email templates. In the global header of Braze, select <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> **Search** (or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>), and a dropdown search menu will open.

## Key features

### Keyboard shortcuts

Navigate through search results effortlessly with keyboard shortcuts:

- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> = Opens the search menu
- <kbd>⬆</kbd> / <kbd>⬇</kbd> = Move between results in the search menu
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> = Select a search result
- <kbd>Esc</kbd> = Closes the search menu

### Content type and status tags

Each search result is paired with tags that indicate the result's content type (campaign, Canvas, segment, or email template) and status (active, archived, stopped, etc.).

### Access recently opened content

You can easily revisit recently accessed content from the search menu. The search interface displays your recently opened results below the search bar, including items interacted with throughout the entire Braze platform. This lets you quickly return to previously viewed campaigns, Canvases, segments, or email templates so you can pick up right where you left off with fewer clicks.

### Explore more results

If your search returns too many results, scroll to continue viewing more items. As you scroll through the search results dropdown, more items will dynamically load, ensuring you have access to all relevant content.
