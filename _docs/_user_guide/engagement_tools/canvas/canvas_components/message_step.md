# Message Step

Message Steps allow you to add a standalone message where you want in your Canvas flow.

## Create a Message Step

To create a Message Step, add a step to your Canvas. Then, use the dropdown at the top of the new step to select **Message**.

With a Message Step, all users who enter the step advance to the next step when any one of the following conditions is met:
- Any message is sent
- A message is not sent because the user is not reachable with a channel
- A message is not sent because it is frequency capped
- A message is not sent because it is aborted

The Message Step also includes settings for Intelligent Delivery and Quiet Hours overrides.

The Message Step allows you to enable Intelligent Timing with a fallback option when a userâ€™s profile does not have enough data to calculate an optimal time. Select **Using Intelligent Timing** in **Delivery Settings**. Here, you can select either the most popular time or a specific fallback time. 

If Quiet Hours are enabled, the Message Step also allows you to override this setting.

For Canvas Message Steps, `event_properties` are not supported. Instead, use `canvas_entry_properties`. Canvas entry properties are properties from the event that kicked off the Canvas. These properties can only be used in the first full step of a Canvas. On the other hand, event properties originate from an event or action that occurs as the user goes through their workflow.

## Analytics

Refer to the following table for definitions of Message Step metrics: 

| Metric | Description |

| Proceeded to Next Step | The number of entries that proceeded to the next step in the Canvas. |
| Sends | The total number of messages the step has sent. If your Canvas re-eligibility and a user enters a Message Step twice, two entries will be recorded. |
