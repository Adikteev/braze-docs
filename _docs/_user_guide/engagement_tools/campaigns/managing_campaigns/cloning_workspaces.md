# Cloning campaigns to workspaces

> You can clone campaigns to a different workspace to keep and build off your successful strategies. 

{% alert important %}
Cloning campaigns to workspaces is currently in early access. Contact your Braze account manager if you're interested in participating in this early access.
{% endalert %}

To clone to a workspace, select the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> gear icon next to the selected campaign, and click **Clone to Workspace**. After cloning to a workspace, we recommend reviewing and testing your campaign to ensure that all fields are working properly.

When you clone a campaign to a workspace, the following fields are cloned:
- Campaign name and description
- Variants
- Email body
- Subject and preheader

Note that Content Blocks will not be cloned. However, a Content Block can be referenced in the destination workspace if a block with the same name exists. Alternatively, you can create the Content Block in the destination workspace to avoid any errors when launching a campaign.
